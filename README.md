# HyperMark Checkout System
This is a management system built on Javascript, HTML, cSS to manage and balance the checkout process at the Mart.

## Features 
 - Dynamically assigns customers to the counter with the least total items.
 - Displays the number of customers and total items per counter.
- Real-time DOM updates without any backend.

## Working
 1. Enter the number of items to checkout.
 2. The system calculates the least crowded checkout counter.
 3. Assigns the customer with that checkout number.

## How to run the project 
  1. Clone the git repository
  2. Run the index.html in browser.


## Algorithm Time complexity will be O(n)


## Assumptions
1. All item counts are valid positive integers.
2. No backend is used — the app runs entirely on the frontend.
3. Customer data is not persisted — reloading the page resets all counters.
